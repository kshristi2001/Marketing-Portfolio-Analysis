# 🛡️ Insurance Data Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of insurance policyholder data to uncover patterns in claims, customer behavior, risk segmentation, and policy effectiveness using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes a real-world insurance dataset to:

- Understand policyholder demographics and behavior
- Identify high-risk customers and fraud-prone claim patterns
- Perform segmentation to personalize marketing and pricing strategies
- Deliver actionable business intelligence through visualizations

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for structured data querying)
- **Power BI** / **Tableau** (for dashboard creation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for EDA and reporting)
- **Git/GitHub** (for version control)

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer demographics, policy types, and claim history  
- Identification of fraud risk patterns based on claim frequency and amount  
- Correlation analysis between age, income, and premium amounts  
- Analysis of churn prediction trends and customer retention behaviors  
- Development of interactive visual dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs)  

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

- 📊 **28%** of total claims originated from policyholders under the age of 35  
- 💰 High correlation found between **low income** and **frequent claim submissions**  
- 🔍 Identified customer segments with **elevated churn risk**  
- 🎯 Personalized policy recommendations driven by demographic profiling  

---

## 📌 Business Impact

- 💡 Enabled data-driven decisions on **premium pricing** and **risk mitigation strategies**  
- 🕵️ Supported **fraud detection** via claim pattern recognition  
- 📣 Enhanced **customer targeting and retention** through segmentation and churn analysis  

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- 🤖 Implement **machine learning models** to predict churn and claim likelihood  
- ☁️ Integrate **AWS services** (e.g., Glue, S3, Redshift) for scalable data pipelines  
- 📊 Deploy **real-time Power BI dashboards** embedded into web portals
